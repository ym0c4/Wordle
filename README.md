# Guess the word (Project)
Welcome to my initial project on GitHub. 
This is a small python project where you can play a "guess the word" game based on brands, items, terms etc. related to cameras. This game is text-based and can easily be played directly in the terminal.

## Introduction
### Rules
- You have 11 chances to guess the correct word.  
- Each correct letter guessed, it will reveal its place(s) in the word.  
- If you run out of turns before completing the word, you lose.  
- All words are related to *cameras*.

### Run on terminal
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone this repository in the terminal with either https://github.com/ym0c4/Wordle.git
or git@github.com:ym0c4/Wordle.git
3. Open the termianal and navigate to where you installed it
4. Run the program with: python3 GuessTheWord.py

Good luck!
